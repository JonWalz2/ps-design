Oh Hai there :wave: ! Welcome to the PowerShell Community Design Repo!
<br><br>

## :bulb: Background

This all started in early in 2019, in the PowerShell Community Slack/Discord/IRC _#bridge_ channel. The abundance of StickerMule deals, coupled with the many wonderful community projects in need of logo’s, gave me a nudge to start creating designs.

I initially started by working on stickers, as they are a fun creative project that can be easily shared with friends at conferences. Over time, I’ve begun working on individual logo commissions, as well as some fun desktop wallpaper.

I try and do most of my work in Inkscape and Gimp, as these are both OSS projects, that deserve to be supported. As well, I’ve always wanted to make creativity accessible by showing people that great work can be done with not a lot of monetary investment. Certain projects, however, have required Photoshop and Illustrator (I’ll try and point out when they do).

I’ve always done my best to share designs and stickers with friends at conferences. However, over time, many people that can’t make it out have mentioned that they would like a sticker or design. And that’s why I created this repo.

Please feel free to peruse the repo, and use whatever you like for your personal enjoyment. If you’d like to post your own requests or designs, please do so via Issues or PR’s. If you end up rocking any of the designs, it’d be real swell if you could tag me on Twitter as [@adilio](https://twitter.com/adilio) . :100:

Also, if you’re intending to reproduce any of these designs in print, please drop me a DM. I don’t bite, promise.

Oh, and please continue being awesome to each other! :heart_eyes: :thumbsup:

## :see_no_evil: A Note About Copyrights

I have done my best to utilize base designs which are free for reuse. In some cases, it is fairly obvious that the idea is a work of satire. I do not intend to use any copyright work belonging to others, without permission. For any such concerns, please go ahead and file an issue, or contact me directly.

## :pray: Project Support

If you dig the work here, and want to contribute to my continued design efforts, please consider picking up an item in the store (COMING SOON). The proceeds will go to project maintainers, and to making free stickers. Any leftover funds will be donated to a charitable cause.

## :raised_hands: Acknowledgements

I was inspired and encouraged by so many in the PowerShell Community, who share the credit for this work. There are too many to name, and I thank you all!

That said, I'd like to shout out a few peeps for their die-hard support:
